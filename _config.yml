# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

home_intro:
  Lately I have been flexing all aspects of what a designer and front end developer does
  along with project management, user strategy and even a bit of DEVOPS work. I enjoy
  interacting with the customer to bring their visions to life with user focused applications
  and user interfaces.

  In my previous life I was in the Navy on submarines I have to admit it was pretty cool and I
  learned quite a bit I found I enjoyed creating web things more. All in all it helps keep me 
  grounded to whats important in life and in my work along with leveling up my ability to handle
  stress!

  It's hard to explain what I used to do in the Navy so I'll let this cool video help do the
  explaining!
